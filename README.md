# ‚öô Median Sample for Statistics

Example of how to use the Median on language R for Statistics using a public data set provided by the R compile

In this example you will learn how to perform simple median statistical measure on language R and run at the R Studio compile and how to use the following libraries: 

### Dplyr
dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges

### Data.table
Data manipulation operations such as subset, group, update, join, etc., are all inherently related. Keeping these related operations together allows for:
  * concise and consistent syntax irrespective of the set of operations you would like to perform to achieve your end goal.
  * performing analysis fluidly without the cognitive burden of having to map each operation to a particular function from a potentially huge set of functions available before performing the analysis.
  * automatically optimizing operations internally, and very effectively, by knowing precisely the data required for each operation, leading to very fast and memory-efficient code.

Briefly, if you are interested in reducing programming and compute time tremendously, then this package is for you. The philosophy that data.table adheres to makes this possible. Our goal is to illustrate it through this series of vignettes.

### ggplot2
ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, and what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.
